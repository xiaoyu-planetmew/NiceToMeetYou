I often wish#I had someone to share my trivial joys and sorrows with#Emotions, however small, shouldn't be ignored#They are like particles in the air#If they are left to be accumulated for too long,#they will cover our world with a layer of dust#I'm a little socially awkward#Life is often too hard for me#
