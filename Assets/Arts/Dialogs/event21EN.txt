I often wish #I had someone to share my trivial joys and sorrows together.#A lot of emotions, insignificant, but can not be ignored. # They are like particles in the air. #If be accumulated too long.# They will make our world covered with a layer of dust.#The crowd don't suit me very well, #My life is a little hard for me too.#
